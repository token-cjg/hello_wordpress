### Script to setup a nodejs process

nb. for generic process, port in nginx-default should be 8080.
But for the coronavirus simulation (app.sh) I use port 3000.

### Getting started

Create a VM and open ports 22, 80, and 443.

Grab setup.sh and app.sh from this repo.

Run setup.sh.

Then run app.sh.

Navigate to your VM ip address.

Done!
